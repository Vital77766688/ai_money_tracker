# 🧠 AI Money Tracker

**AI Money Tracker** is a personal finance automation tool that uses AI to help you track expenses via Telegram. It processes user messages with AI and stores categorized financial records in a database. The goal is to showcase your backend engineering skills, asynchronous architecture, and AI tool integration.

---

## 📌 Features

- Add expenses via a Telegram bot
- Use AI (via OpenAI API) to extract amount, category, and description from text
- Store structured records in a PostgreSQL database
- Handle background tasks for parsing and categorizing inputs
- Track user-specific budgets and expenses

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **FastAPI** – for asynchronous web services
- **PostgreSQL** – relational database backend
- **SQLAlchemy + Alembic** – ORM and DB migrations
- **python-telegram-bot v20+** – for Telegram bot integration
- **OpenAI API** – for natural language understanding
- **AsyncIO** – async handlers for fast response time

---

## 🧠 Techniques Implemented

- **Async Telegram bot + FastAPI backend** architecture
- **Prompt engineering** to extract structured data from free-text expense descriptions
- **Repository pattern** to separate business logic from persistence
- **Environment variable configuration** for secrets and API keys
- **Modular project layout** for scalability and maintainability

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vital77766688/ai_money_tracker.git
cd ai_money_tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create and fill `.env` file

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=...
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=tracker
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

### 3. Use the bot

Send messages like:
```
Spent $25 on groceries today
```
The bot will use AI to extract:
- Amount: 25
- Category: groceries
- Date: today (parsed into proper date format)
